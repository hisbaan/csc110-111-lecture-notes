* Exercise 1: Graph terminology review

One of the tricky things about learning graphs is that there's a lot of terminology to understand. This exercise will give you the opportunity to practice using this terminology on a concrete example.

#+latex: \noindent
Consider the graph below:

#+attr_latex: :height 200px
[[./lecture-13-images/graph5.png]]

1. How many vertices does this graph have?

   There are 7 vertices: \(V = \{A, B, C, D, E, F, G\}\).

2. How many edges does this graph have?

   There are 11 edges: \(E = \{\{A, B\}, \{A, C\}, \{A, D\}, \{B, D\}, \{B, E\}, \{B, G\}, \{C, E\}, \{C, F\}, \{C, G\}, \\ \{D, G\}, \{F, G\}\}\).

3. List all the vertices that are adjacent to vertex G.

   \(\{B, C, D, F\}\).

4. Find a /path/ that goes through all vertices of the graph. (Remember that a path cannot have any duplicate vertices.)

   One such path is \(A, D, G, F, C, E, B\).

* Exercise 2: A property of vertex degrees

Recall that the *degree* of a vertex \(v\), denoted \(d(v)\), is its number of neighbours.

Answer the following questions about this definition.

1. Let \(G = (V, E)\) be the graph from Exercise 1. Complete the table below showing the /degree/ of each vertex. We've done the first row for you.

   | Vertex | Degree |
   |--------+--------|
   | A      |      3 |
   | B      |      4 |
   | C      |      4 |
   | D      |      3 |
   | E      |      2 |
   | F      |      2 |
   | G      |      4 |

2. What is the /sum of the degrees/ of all the vertices in the above table?

   \(3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 22\)

3. Compare your answer to Question 2 and the /number of edges/ of this graph (Question 2 in Exercise 1). What do you notice?

   The sum of the degrees of all the vertices in the graph is equal to double the number of edges in the graph. \(\displaystyle{} \sum_{v \in V} d(v) = 2 \cdot |E|\).

4. Prove the following graph property: for all graphs \(G = (V, E)\), \(\displaystyle{\sum_{v \in V} d(v) = 2 \cdot |E|}\). Your proof body can consist of a short explanation written in English.

   /Note/: \(\displaystyle{\sum_{v \in V}}\) means “sum over all vertices \(v\) in \(V\)”.

   #+begin_latex
   WTS \(\displaystyle{} \forall G = (V, E), \sum_{v \in V} d(v) = 2 \cdot |E|\)

   \underline{Proof:}

   Let \(G = (V, E)\) be an arbitrary graph

   For a vertex \(v\), \(d(v)\), is the number of edges that "touch" (incident) that vertex.

   We know that each edge touches exactly 2 vertices. This means each edge will be counted by exactly two of the \(d(v)\) expressions in the summation. 1 egde will represent 2 total degrees. 4 edges will represent 8 total degrees.

   Thus we know that the sum of the \(d(v)\) (over all \(v \in V\)) is equal to double the number of edges. \(\blacksquare\)

* Additional exercises

1. Let \(G = (V, E)\) be a graph, and assume that for all \(v \in V\), \(d(v) \leq 5\). Find and prove a good upper bound (exact, not asymptotic) on the total number of edges, \(|E|\), in terms of the number of vertices, \(|V|\).

   Formally, you can think of this as proving the following statement (after filling in the blank):

   \[\forall G = (V, E),~ \big(\forall v \in V,~ d(v) \leq 5\big) \Rightarrow |E| \leq \rule{2cm}{0.4pt}\]
